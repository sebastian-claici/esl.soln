# Notes for *Elements of Statistical Learning*

This repository contains self-attempted solutions to the exercises in Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman's text [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). I make no guarantees at the correctness of the proofs, and I would recommend you use these only as a starting point.

The notes are gathered into a single [PDF file](notes/main.pdf). There is a table of contents for easier navigation.
